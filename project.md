1.	Introduction


This is a project for Software Engineering course, fall 2014, Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. We are required to create a software requirements specification for an application utilizing indoor positioning system. Our group has chosen a mobile application that would be helpful to exchange students. The name of our application is hobbies mobile application. The application will work hand in hand with Metropolia’s tuubi as the information of the student will be first taken from the tuubi system. The student will be informed of this application on date of orientation. 
Every year, there are hundreds of exchange student come to study at Metropolia. We were first inspired to come up with this idea to help them to have great experiences during their stay. 
The application will help them find and connect to students with similar hobbies. During registration, they can list their interests. The data will be saved on the server and they will be notice about nearby students with similar interests.

2.	Use Cases


A.	User group: 
This mobile application is available to all Metropolia students. The user group is all Metropolia students and of course exchange students. 
B.	User stories:
Exchange student: As an exchange student, I want to make quick friends to share some good times based on my interest after school activity because my time here is short.
Metropolia Student: As a degree student, I want the software to be easy to learn and use and can find exchange student from specific country that I would like to visit.

C.	 User scenario:

Initial state: First user Install application
	Normal flow: Register with student ID, List hobbies and interest, select information to share public.
	What can go wrong: Exposure of private information, distraction in class and phone lost leading untargeted group meeting the exchange.
	What can happen at the same time: A lot of students might update their account or download the application.
	End State: Students find the right people

4. Requirements: (in traceable (and measurable) format)

Functional requirements

•	Utilize indoor positioning system
•	Work on Android (ver. ), iOS (ver…), WinPhone  (ver…)
•	Function over Wi-Fi network
•	Send push-notifications when a match is nearby.
•	Metropolia map
•	Send and receive message
•	Share current status

Non-functional system requirements
•	Performance requirements should run on every smartphones
•	Decreasing the probability of losing data
•	Software quality attribute: user friendliness  
Usability: how do you ensure that your system is easy to use?
•	Using similar terms as popular social network (example Facebook)
•	Introduce during orientation
•	Include information in welcome package
Reliability: how do you ensure that your system is reliable? List the possible system failures and how the system reacts to them
•	Wi-Fi failure: 
•	Server failure: 
•	Indoor Positioning System failure
Efficiency: there are multiple people using your system. How do ensure that the system is efficient enough? What metrics would you use?
•	Use indoor positioning system to perform a study of what is the peak number of students to be on campus at the same time. 
•	Design server to be cable of handing 150% load of that peak number.
What other non-functional requirements should be documented?
•	It is a free software, anyone could run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve
•	
What kind of metrics you should use to guarantee unambiguity?
•	Using similar terms as popular social network (example Facebook)
6. User interface

What are the views / components of the system? What are the functionalities of each view?
